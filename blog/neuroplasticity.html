        <h3>What is Neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to change and adapt due to
          experience. This happens through the changing, reorganisation and
          growth of neural networks that occur due to learning and exposure.
        </p>

        <h3>This benefits your:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Ability to learn new things</li>
          <li>Enhances you cognitive capabilities</li>
          <li>
            Recover or repair functionality, eg from brain injuries or stroke
          </li>
          <li>Strength brain function and knowledge</li>
          <li>Reduce the decline of brain function</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How to use it with my learning?</h3>
        <p>
          By understanding the hypothesis of neuroplasticity I am able to
          incorporate it into my learning and improve my understanding of how
          the learning process works.
        </p>

        <h3>How to improve your neuroplasticity?</h3>
        <p>
          Generate an environment with lots of stimulus that allows focus,
          attention and challenges.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <p>Such as:</p>
          <li>Learning a new language</li>
          <li>Learning a new topic</li>
          <li>Learning an instrument</li>
          <li>Travelling exploring</li>
          <li>Reading</li>
        </ul>

        <h1 style="text-align: center">Growth Mindset</h1>

        <h3>What is a Growth Mindset?</h3>
        <p>
          Growth mindset is the belief system that an individual's own talents
          can be developed and improved through hard-work, strategies and
          support. It’s relevance stems from its benefits as a positive thinking
          mechanism that allows a student to understand they are not limited.
        </p>

        <h3>My exploration reflection</h3>
        <p>
          I understood the growth mindset prior to the research and found
          nothing to be particularly surprising, just a re-enforcement of
          existing knowledge.
        </p>

        <h3>How will it integrate into my own learning?</h3>
        <p>
          I believe to integrate the growth mindset into my own learn is just to
          simply employ the ideology and maintain an open mind in my learnings
        </p>

        <h3>Personal Reflection</h3>

        <p>
          This doesn’t change my learning plan or strategy however just tools in
          which i can better achieve and employ in my journey to achieve the
          goals set.
