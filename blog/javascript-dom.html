      <h1 id="title">JavaScript and Document Object Model</h1>
      <p>A dummies take on JavaScript and DOM</p>
    </div>

    <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript forms the holy trinity of HTML5 which is the newest version of
      the World Wide Web's core language. Where HTML builds the structure of the
      webpage, CSS gives that same structure some pzazz. But all that form is
      useless without some function. That's where JavaScript comes in, it is
      responsible for all the things that give the website life and character.
    </p>

    <h2>Some benefits of JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript allows the programmer to have control over the execution of the
      code through 'control flow'. Control flow is a very important and widely
      used concept in JavaScript. It determines what sections of code are run at
      a specific time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just a few examples are conditional statements or loops. Each serving its
      own purpose to allow the code to run in a specific way.
    </p>
    <div style="display: flex">
      <div style="flex: 50%">
        <h3>Conditional statements:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Examples:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>if statements</li>
            <li>else</li>
            <li>else if</li>
            <li>switch cases</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            They act as gatekeepers for sections of code, making sure only the
            code only executes when appropriate or when certain conditions are
            met.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div style="flex: 50%">
        <h3>Loops and iteration:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Examples:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>for loops</li>
            <li>for-each</li>
            <li>forEach</li>
            <li>do</li>
            <li>while</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Loops save coders a significant amount of time and resources. It
            allows the code to run code multiple times over without having to
            duplicate the code or large sections of code for the equivalent of
            for example a for loop. It allows for working with 2-dimensional
            objects much more feasible such as matrices
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>How does JavaScript fit in</h2>
    <p>
      JavaScript is an object oriented language thus has an pre-established
      interface for interacting with the HTML elements. This interface is called
      the Document Object Model or DOM (for the cool kids)
    </p>
    <p>
      The DOM represents the html documents by breaking down the page into nodes
      and objects. This is what allows JavaScript to interact with the elements
      on a webpage. JavaScript then is able to use its magic to manipulate and
      play with each element as it pleases.
    </p>

    <h2>Arrays and Objects</h2>
    <p>One of the ways it can do this is through objects and arrays.</p>
    <div style="display: flex">
      <div style="flex: 50%">
        <h3>Objects:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Represents a specific 'thing' in your code</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Such as:</li>
            <li>A person</li>
            <li>A car</li>
            <li>A building</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            They allow the user to give the objects properties or 'keys' that
            act as an attribute for that specific object. Furthermore, you can
            assign those attributes 'values', this allows them to be more
            descriptive of the object it is associated with and these can be
            accessed, changed and removed.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <div style="flex: 50%">
        <h3>Array</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Represents a list</li>
          <li>
            Stores a list of values in a single variable. Compared to the object
            which can have multiple keys or variables. Arrays can be part of an
            object but not the other way around. These almost act as a container
            to store a certain set of data. These can also be accessed, changed
            or removed.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Functions</h2>
    <p>
      When coding you are essentially writing code to do a specific 'function'
      that allows it to either compute, manipulate or review data. Oftentimes as
      a programmer you find yourself repeating the same tasks or re-writing the
      same bit of code to be used again and again. To save time we can use
      functions, liken it to a worker whose role is to perform just one
      function, and we can call it to do it over and over again without having
      to re-train a new worker. This is basically how a function operates. It is
      a code that performs a function we can recall again again and again to
      perform said operation.
