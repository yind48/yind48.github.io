    <h2>
      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </h2>
    <p>I think these play roles in various aspects of the two such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Being able to understand yourself, what your limits are, what your
        weakness are and how you can improve
      </li>
      <li>
        Being able to understand your position within a team/unit and how you
        can positively contribute
      </li>
      <li>
        In a social situation with classmates or colleagues how you can
        positively contribute
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What has surprised you the most about core learning?</h2>
    <p>
      How much I am able to write down. I usually see myself as quiet, closed
      and reserved.

    <h2>
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </h2>
    <p>
      From my experience in the workforce, I understand that you could be the
      smartest and most academic person in the office but that's no use if you
      can`t work in a team and contribute to the team's overall goals. I believe
      with my limited exposure to web development that would also be applicable.

    <h2>
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
      time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?
      Justify your answer.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Not a waste of time, yes it does feel like a divergence from the normal
      programming learning but it's nice to learn. I am aware of the topics
      prior to the core course but actively thinking about them and reflecting
      of their role in my own life is quiet enlightening
