      <h2>Situation where ethical decision making has been required</h2>
      <p>
        Prior to my current life I was a Immigration Officer for Immigration NZ.
        Where I had to make numerous decisions that presented multiple ethical
        conundrum's. However, I am proud to say I have played my part in keeping
        dream's alive, families together and creating many happy moments in
        people's live's. I have also unfortunately played my part in the other
        scenario's too. I reflect on these decision's knowing that I did the
        best I could both professionally and as a fellow human.
      </p>

      <h2>How culture and people have influenced my values and identity</h2>
      <p>
        I believe peoples culture and company have a significant influence on
        the values and and identities we adopt and present. I personally have
        felt the influence in my life when reflecting on my own identity and
        values. I believe the nuture side of my upbringing from my family to my
        friends ultimately drove my actions and intentions which has led to who
        I call 'me' today.
      </p>

      <h2>Identifying strengths and their effects on my learning</h2>
      <p>
        My strengths that have stood out and I am proud to say I am hardworking
        and always willing to trying my best. This has been reflected in all
        that I do, professionally and personally. I believe this will ensure my
        work ethics in up to standard as the journey continues.
      </p>

      <h2>Identifying limitations and their effects on my learning</h2>
      <p>
        I am of the understanding no one is perfect and no one can be perfect
        but we are simply perfectly imperfect. Sometimes when I come across
        paths where I feel imperfect this leads to me feeling a little
        demotivated. I do understand my limitations and weaknesses, however, can
        only hope I remain proactive and motivated to navigate the difficulties
        in my learning and career.
      </p>

      <h2>
        Reflection on a time where I have worked collaboratively and how I
        navigated any difficulties
      </h2>
      <p>
        Professionally and academically collaboration has been a major
        component. Many a times idea's are recieved as you would hope. I just
        reflect and try to understand that we are all different and think in our
        own way. The simplest way is to try to understand each others thought
        process for that decision and being open minded. This leads to a
        unobstructed path to compromise where the best of both idea's come
        together.
