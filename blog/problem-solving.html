              During Sprint 4 I had come across an exercise where the code would
              produce the output but had just one very minor issue with it that
              didn`t let it pass. No matter how I wrote the code it would still
              have the issue.

              I used multiple techniques:

                <li>Googling</li>
                <li>
                  Brute force of just jamming in the different possible ways I
                  think it might work
                </li>
                <li>Taking time away from the problem</li>
                <li>Trying to debug the code to find issues</li>
                <li>Console logging</li>

              The feeling was pure frustration, I just couldn’t see why things
              weren’t working

            <td>
              I learned many different methods for strings and arrays as a
              result of googling and slowing inching one step closer to knowing
              how to debug like a coder

              Elegant problem solving isn’t one of my strong suits. I believe
              that one of the only elegant problem solving events is when the
              code has an error due to a simple syntax or spelling mistake

          <tr>
            <td><b>What problem-solving techniques did you use?</b></td>
            <td>
              As the only times i have elegantly problem solved was when the
              problem was fairly simple I only use:
              <ul>
                <li>Console logging</li>
                <li>Reading/checking the code over</li>
                <li>Taking time away from the problem</li>

          <tr>
            <td><b>How did you feel throughout the process? </b></td>
            <td>
              Generally this process results in a much calmer life, however,
              still annoying that I messed up something so simple
            </td>

            <td><b>What did you learn?</b></td>

              Makes me realise I need to be more careful and try and avoid
              little errors like that
            </td>

    <h2>Problem solving techniques</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Pseudocode</li>
      <li>Trying something</li>
      <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
      <li>Reading error messages</li>
      <li>Console.logging</li>

      <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
      <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      I like to believe that I am pretty confident with all the problem solving
      methods bar the 'asking' ones. I think at times I can also be a little
      scared to ask.
    </p>

    <h2>A time where I was reluctant to ask</h2>
    <p>
      I think throughout the foundation I have been reluctant to ask for help a
      lot. I think it's mainly out of stubbornness and wanting to find the
      answers for myself. This is generally because I usually finish with extra
      time that allows me to take some time and problem solve for myself. I
      think it also stems from the fact I learn by doing rather than being told.
