      <h2>Long Term Goal</h2>
      <p>
        Long term goal resulting from my experience at DevAcademy is to be able
        to pursue a career in software development/engineering that continues to
        allow me to enjoy what I like doing.
      </p>

      <h2>Strengths and Limitions</h2>

      <h2>Desired learrning (not technical) I would like to take away</h2>
      <p>
        No specific interpersonal skills I can think of, however, I do wish to
        just learn to enjoy my time more and enjoy what I am doing a bit more.
        Previously, I have found myself doing things for the sake of just doing
        it, e.g work, etc.
      </p>

      <h2>How will I manage my workload</h2>
      <p>
        I usually like to tackle things head on, do it as it comes. I don't have
        a specific plan in mind, other than just take it one step at a time. I
        think I might have to remember to tell myself to reach out sometimes, I
        do find that if I am not prompted I do keep to myself quite a bit. This
        might come really important especially when things start to build up.
      </p>

      <h2>How will I seek help</h2>
      <p>
        I would like to see myself open up a bit more. I am trying to make
        myself reach out and put myself out there more. I saw that change in the
        first Sprint, being the first one to send an Intro out to the whole
        cohort, quite nerve-wrecking.
      </p>

      <h2>Expectations of the facilitators</h2>
      <p>
        My expectations are simple, just a safe and supportive team to make sure
        I am doing the best I can and willing to step in when needed.
      </p>

      <h2>Outside time</h2>
      <p>
        As a young adult in today's society, my time commitments remain bare. I
        like to make sure I am not doing anything work or school related after 5
        o'clock as a rule. I do find time to relax and be around my friends and
        family but nothing is set in stone. I generally take it as it happens
        but do the regular gaming session, weekend away or just general catch
        ups.
